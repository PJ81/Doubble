This is a simple implementation of the * Dobble * card game.
You can create as many cards as you want, as long as you use 
a prime number size grid to generate your deck of cards. 
Basically, call the Doubble constructor with a prime number 
as argument.
And, of course, you must have enough symbols to display on 
the cards. If n is the size of your matrix, then you need:
n * (n + 1) + 1 symbols.
