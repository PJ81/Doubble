This is a simple implementation of the * Dobble * card game.
It is able to create as many cards as you want, as long as the
the number of cards you create is prime, and you have enough 
symbols to be displayed on them.
If n is the number of cards you are creating, then you will 
need n * (n + 1) + 1 symbols.
